# CORS
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a system, consisting of transmitting HTTP headers, that determines whether browsers block frontend JavaScript code from accessing responses for cross-origin requests.

The same-origin security policy forbids cross-origin access to resources. But CORS gives web servers the ability to say they want to opt into allowing cross-origin access to their resources.

# Proxy

A proxy server is an intermediary server that acts as a gateway between a client and a destination server. It can improve the security and privacy of online communications by filtering out malicious content, hiding the client's IP address, and improving the performance of internet requests. Proxies can also be used to circumvent geographic restrictions and censorship. There are several types of proxies, including HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS, and reverse proxies.
